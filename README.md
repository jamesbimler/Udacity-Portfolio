## Investigating relationships between firearm transactions and census data

This project, part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree, delves into data from two primary sources. The FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) captures various transactions related to firearms and explosives, including gun sales, concealed carry permits, and more. The second data source is the US census, offering state-level statistics from 2010 to 2016. The analysis combines these datasets to explore the relationship between gun background checks and demographic factors. It examines overall trends, specific transactions, states with the highest checks, growth patterns, and demographic profiles, focusing on race, veteran status, immigrant status, education, income, and population density. 

### Here are the questions I answer in this analysis:
- What states experience the largest growth in background checks per capita over time
- What are the overall trends in background checks categorized by firearm types (handgun, long gun, and others)

### Requirements
- Jupter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
